#  Cat Coin Bot   Date: 8/13/2023                                                                                                       
# =======================================================================================================================================
# A Discord Bot that works as a sort log in and get a coin which you can then use the in shop.
# The prefix for the bot is the '!' 

# Currently the commands are a register, balance, gen for generating the coin, and the gambling feature.

# In addition to this, the program is linked up to a database through SQLITE3. 
# The downside at this current point is that the bot has to be run locally unfortunately. 
# The general idea is that a user would connect each day to get one coin, but the way that they can get more coins is through Gambling.
# Work in Progress: 
#There are 9 levels which at this current point is the following:
# ===================================================
# Level 1 is 80% for a 1.1x multiplier
# Level 2 is 50% for a 1.5x multiplier
# Level 3 is 30% for a 2x multiplier
#Level 4 is 20% for a 3x multiplier
# Level 5 is 10% for a 5x multiplier
# Level 6 is 5% for a 10x multiplier
# Level 7 is 0.5% for a 20x multiplier
# Level 8 is 0.1% for a 50x multiplier
# Level 9 is 0.01% for a 100x multiplier
# ===================================================
#To Do List:
#Currently, the display for the gambling system does not work, but in due time it will hopefully work.
#I have plans to put a 24hr timer on the !gen command.
#Additiionally, I also have to implement the buy command and the shop command.
# As of this current moment, I do not know what exactly is going to be in the shop.
# However, I also have plans to add a command that will put stuff into the database for new items.
# That's all that I have currently, I wish anyone who reads this an amazing rest of your day see ya!
